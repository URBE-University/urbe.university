            <p class="mt-3">Biennial Review of URBE Alcohol and Other Drug Programs 2019-2020</p>

            <p class="mt-3">The Drug Free Schools and Campus Regulations (34 CFR Part 86) of the Drug Free Schools and Communities Act (DFSCA) require an institution of higher education (IHE) such asURBE University to certify it has implemented programs to prevent the abuse of alcohol and use or distribution of illicit drugs both by URBE University students and employees, both on its premises and as a part of any of its activities.</p>
            <p class="mt-3 font-medium">At a minimum each institution of higher education must annually distribute the following in writing to all students and employees:</p>

            <ul class="ml-4 mt-3 list-disc">
              <li>Standards of conduct that clearly prohibit the unlawful possession, use or distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol by students and employees.</li>
              <li>A description of the legal sanctions under local, state, or federal law for the unlawful possession or distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol.</li>

            </ul>

            <p class="mt-3 font-medium">The law further requires that the institution conduct a biennial review of its program with the following objectives:</p>
            <ul class="ml-4 mt-3 list-disc">
              <li>Determining the effectiveness of the policy and implementing changes to the alcohol and other drug programs if they are needed.</li>
              <li>To ensure that the sanctions developed are enforced consistently.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="mt-6">
            <h3 class="text-urbe text-xl font-semibold">The biennial review must also include a determination as to:</h3>

            <h3 class="text-urbe text-xl font-semibold">Health Risks and Effects</h3>
            <p class="mt-3">Alcohol and drug usage causes a number of marked changes in behavior. Even low doses significantly impair the judgment and coordination required to drive a car safely. Low to moderate doses of alcohol also increase the incidence of a variety of aggressive acts, including domestic violence and date rape. Moderate to high doses of alcohol cause mark impairments in higher mental functions, severely altering a person’s ability to learn and remember information. Very high doses cause respiratory depression and death.</p>
            <p class="mt-3">Repeated use of alcohol and drugs can lead to dependence. Sudden cessation of alcohol intake is likely to produce withdrawal symptoms, including severe anxiety, tremors, hallucinations, and convulsions. Long term consumption of large quantities of alcohol and drugs, particularly when combined with poor nutrition, can also lead to permanent damage to vital organs such as the brain and the liver.</p>
